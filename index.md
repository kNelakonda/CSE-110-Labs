## About Me:

**Who am I?**
> I'm a 23 year old student currently studying at UCSD. I major in Computer Science.

**Ok but who are _you_?**
> I am still finding myself. Currently I enjoy the challenges that being an engineer, an athlete, and a video game player provide. I love when things are simple yet effective, and it's why I think [Python is an awesome programming language.](README.md)
> For example, printing "Hello World!"
> Java: `System.out.println("Hello World!");`
> Python: `print("Hello World!")`

**Tell me more about you as a Programmer though, that seems the most interesting....**
> Well a I know a few languages, such as:
- Python
- Javascript
- Java
- C++
> But in reality, I learned them in the order of:
1. Java
2. JavaScript
3. C++
4. Python
> Weird order, but that's how it was.

## My Future:

**So what do you want to do with your life at this point?**
- [ ]  Get a Bachelor's Degree
- [ ]  Maybe get a Master's Degree
- [ ]  Get a Software Engineering Job
- [ ]  Live a happy life

> Yes, seems boring, but you never know where life takes you. A [tweet I found that really expresses this.](https://twitter.com/Duderichy/status/1537818818206044161)
